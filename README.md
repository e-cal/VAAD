# Virtual Assistant Attention Detection
This project enables a user to interact with a virtual assistant without
explicitly activating the assistant. The app is powered by a CNN trained to
identify when the user is paying attention to the device. When the model
determines that the user is paying attention, it begins listening and sends
the user's request to the Google Assistant API.
